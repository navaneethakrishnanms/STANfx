# ðŸŽ‰ ALL BUGS FIXED - Photo Editor

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. **MASK FEATURE - Overlay System** 
**Problem:** The mask feature was cutting/clipping the image instead of overlaying
**Solution:** 
- Completely rewrote mask feature to work as an OVERLAY system
- Upload an image that appears ON TOP of your main image
- Drag to move the overlay image
- Drag corners to resize
- Adjust opacity with slider
- Click "Apply Mask to Image" to permanently merge

**How it works now:**
1. Click "Mask" tool
2. Upload an image file
3. The image appears on your canvas with green handles
4. Drag the image to position it
5. Drag corner handles to resize
6. Adjust opacity slider (0-100%)
7. Click "Apply Mask to Image" to merge permanently

### 2. **COLLAGE FEATURE - Scrolling Fixed**
**Problem:** Collage options were not visible due to no scrolling in sidebar
**Solution:**
- Added `max-height` to sidebar-right for proper scrolling
- Fixed collage preview styling
- Added proper button styling for layout selection
- All collage options now visible and accessible

**Improvements:**
- Sidebar scrolls smoothly
- Layout buttons have proper selected state (blue background)
- Preview box shows clear status
- All 4 image upload fields visible

### 3. **CSS Improvements**
- Fixed sidebar scrolling with `max-height: calc(100vh - 70px)`
- Added proper styling for collage preview box
- Added hover and selected states for layout buttons
- Improved overall UI responsiveness
