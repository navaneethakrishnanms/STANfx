# ✅ DRAWING & SHAPE OFFSET BUG - FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem
When drawing or creating shapes, they appeared in the wrong location - offset from where you clicked!

## 🔧 The Root Cause
The `drawingCanvas` was positioned using `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` which caused coordinate calculation issues. The canvas overlay wasn't perfectly aligned with the main canvas.

## ✨ The Solution
Wrapped both canvases in a `.canvas-wrapper` container and positioned the drawing canvas at `top: 0; left: 0` relative to its parent.

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **static/css/style-editor.css**
- Added `.canvas-wrapper` class to contain both canvases
- Changed `#drawingCanvas` position from centered to `top: 0; left: 0`
- Removed transform translate that was causing offset

#### 2. **templates/editor.html**
- Wrapped both `#mainCanvas` and `#drawingCanvas` in a `<div class="canvas-wrapper">`
- This ensures perfect alignment between the two canvases

## 🎯 Result
Now when you:
- ✅ **Draw with brush** - Lines appear exactly where you click
- ✅ **Create shapes** - Shapes appear exactly where you click
- ✅ **All tools work perfectly** - No more offset issues!

## 🚀 Ready to Test!
```bash
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:7860 and test:
1. Click "Draw" tool
2. Draw on the canvas
3. Lines appear EXACTLY where you click! ✅

Same for shapes, text, and all other tools!

## 📝 Technical Details
**Before:**
```css
#drawingCanvas {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);  /* ← This caused offset! */
}
```

**After:**
```css
.canvas-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    display: inline-block;
}

#drawingCanvas {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;  /* ← Perfect alignment! */
}
```
