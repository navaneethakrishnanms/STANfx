EDITOR FIXES COMPLETED - FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

WHAT I FIXED:
-------------
1. ✅ LEFT SIDEBAR SCROLLING 
   - The sidebar now scrolls so you can see ALL tools including Collage
   - Modified: static/css/style-editor.css

2. ✅ HTML MASK UI UPDATED
   - Changed from "cut/clip" to "overlay/add image"
   - Added file upload, opacity slider, preview
   - Modified: templates/editor.html

3. ✅ NEW MASK METHODS CREATED
   - All new JavaScript methods for overlay functionality
   - Saved in: static/js/mask-methods.js

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
================================================================================

The JavaScript file (editor.js) needs the old mask methods REPLACED with new ones.

MANUAL STEPS:
-------------

STEP 1: Open static/js/editor.js

STEP 2: Search for "// NEW: Mask feature methods" (around line 1074)

STEP 3: DELETE these 3 old methods:
   - drawMaskPath()
   - applyMask() [the old version]
   - clearMask()
   
   They are approximately lines 1074-1110

STEP 4: Open static/js/mask-methods.js

STEP 5: Copy ALL the content from mask-methods.js

STEP 6: Paste it in editor.js where you deleted the old methods

STEP 7: Save editor.js

================================================================================
OR USE THIS QUICK FIX:
================================================================================

Delete lines 1074-1110 in editor.js (the old mask methods) and add this at the same location:

[Copy everything from mask-methods.js file]

================================================================================
NEW MASK FEATURE DOES:
================================================================================

✓ Upload a second image to overlay on your main image
✓ Drag the overlay image to position it anywhere
✓ Resize the overlay by dragging corner handles (green squares)
✓ Adjust transparency with the opacity slider
✓ "Apply Mask" button to merge it permanently
✓ "Remove Mask" button to cancel and remove overlay

================================================================================

2. Upload and open an image in editor
3. Scroll down in left sidebar to see Collage button (now visible!)
4. Click "Mask" button in left sidebar
5. Click "Upload Mask Image" and choose an image
